## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (or I hope)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use figma, because I already know basics of html & css, flexbox, calc and responsive design. I needed reminder how to use rem.

### Useful resources

- [Różnica między jednostkami em i rem w CSS](https://clivio.pl/roznica-miedzy-jednostkami-em-i-rem-w-css/) - This helped me to understand, how rem works in CSS. I'm still unsure where I should use rem, em & px. But fonts are good place to start, because it's important for accessibility.
